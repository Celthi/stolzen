Dealing with prodigious amounts of data.
Upon graduation I decided to take a gap, because I wanted to acquire practical knowledge, 
know what IT business needs from inside (insider information) 
Currently ... in the foreseeable future in big demand will be data scientists: programmers with statistics skills. Enterprises have gained (?) lots of information for last decades and each year the number of data is increased twofold. Thus data scientists are in a big demand. I work as a regular java developer and I see that I lack certain skills both theoretical and applied. (field experience). Cannot be handled by a single computer, so computing clusters ... 

This gave me a good insight into current demands. 

Not limited to the scope of work. I actively participated in open source projects. Open source project jtalks.org - team lead - for java community for Russian-speaking programmers. Dispatching system for factories. Open source - name, links, experience in building enterprise-level application from scratch. Process, code quality, collaboration, mentoring, etc. not just a team player. 

So in future I would like to concentrate on the following areas: data warehousing, big data, data mining, cloud computing and multi-agent environment, plus functional programming.

Companies like Google, Yandex, EMC, Facebook etc are highly interested to hire programmers with this kind of experience. 

My dream job would be a job of programmer with high inclination towards statistics and data analysis. With challenging tasks leaving enough information to write an article or make a presentation on a conference. And the study will contribute immensely to this.
