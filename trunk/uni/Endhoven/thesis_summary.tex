The work on the project was started on 01.12.2009 and finished on 02.10.2010.

\

\

The main goal of the project is to automate the sales records information flow in ``Sterh, ltd'', Birobidzan, Russia.

\


Resolved tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis of the company's organizational structure. Creating its description.
\item Analysis of its business processes.
\item Analysis of the level of automation. Identification possible subjects of automation.
\item Creating the conceptual part of the system, use-cases analysis.
\item Development of the database structure.
\item Implementation of the end-user application.
\item Calculation of economic efficiency of the project.
\end{itemize}

Nowadays there are so many different companies, and the main factor of success of any of them is correct and proper automation of its business processes. The modern market dictates that a company has to constantly improve its effectiveness of production, as quickly as possible react on any possible change, strive to improve the quality of customer service, reduce losses, build reliable forecasts. For all these reasons managers have to possess reliable operation and strategic data and be able to analyze thoroughly the company in real-time.

Information systems facilitate this process.

\

Sterh ltd. in Birobidzan is a small retailing company, but due to rise of many competitors it was ... to optimize and accelerate its business processes. The initial goal of this thesis is to analyze the information flows and find areas to improve.

My? task was to help them do it with new tailored to their needs information system.

During the research of the information flow a bottleneck was identified in the . The records were kept in old system Business Pack which were filled (переполенена) with old unneeded data, above all which were counterintuitive for its users. What is more, many records were kept in Excel spread sheets which made impossible to index the data there and search there, delivery data in small access database. The common (integrated) solution was needed.

Therefore, the main goal of the graduation work is to create an automated information system for sales records business process.

\

Methods of solving the problem:

\begin{itemize}
\item analyzing and designing business processes using CASE-tools BPWin, IDEF0 and DFD notations;
\item designing the application model with CASE-tools Rational Roses and the UML notation;
\item designing database schemata using CASE-tools ERWin;
\item developing the end-user application in ``Microsoft Visual Studio 2008'' programing environment, in a high-level programming language C\# plus the Firebird database engine.
\end{itemize}

\

The thesis consists of three chapters.

The first chapter is analytical, which analyzes organizational and economical structures of Sterh. ltd as well as its level of automation of management information flow, and the objects and subjects of possible automation are identified. as a result of this chapters, the object is identified (the goods flow), possible solution to automate is suggested.

The second chapter of the project contains information about gathering use-cases, building the conceptual model, creating high-level design diagrams. Then the database structure is describes and the main ideas of the application. Additionally, legal and security problems are considered.

In the third chapter economic efficiency of the AIS is calculated. The main idea of the calculation is the time saved by users. As the result, the payback period of the product is 15 months.

% In addition to this final qualifying work contains a large number of schemes, which reflect business processes, as well as many pictures that show the look has developed an information system.

The main practical result of the final graduate thesis is the automated information system accounting barter company. The system was adopted by Sterh in the autumn of 2010.
