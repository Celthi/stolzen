Through learning Alexey showed himself as an active, serious and conscientious student. Being a high performer, he was among the upper 5% of his group, and he was studying with interest and awareness of necessity of solid knowledge. The regular curriculum problems were easy for him, and he was always willing to do extra. Alexey proved to have an inclination towards scientific and research work.

As a person, Alexey showed good communication skills. He understands the value of collaboration, listens actively, and always asks clarifying questions. Also, he provides a well-reasoned position, effectively conveys ideas in a structured way, actively joins discussions, and able to work out mutually agreeable solutions. He is open-minded, and that lets him easily get along with both students and teachers.

Additionally, he demonstrated eagerness to propagate knowledge. When his classmate had problems to understand something, he willingly tried to explain difficult part from different angles.
