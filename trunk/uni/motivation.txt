motivation; main idea - getting master's degree, solving interesting problems, 
doctoral and PhD. Main - interesting researches, material for articles and papers, conferences 
attending conferences, experience exchange; constant self-improving, opportunity to use Maths.

for these my personal skills and university's opportunities will help

Gap years, reason: acquiring practical skills, time to think over the way of future studying 

Ways: 
functional programming, multiagent systems, data mining, big data. In demand data scientists. 

Very complex systems often require accurate optimization, redesigning, etc.

Generic algorithms also appear interesting for me - fast approximate solution for difficult problems.

Applied experience - have. Need research experience.

The main thing absent (or limited) in Russian universities (majority) international cross-cultural interaction,
and less experienced tutors in interested for me fields. 

Why I? 
- applied experience, little research experience
- good background, but I wish to constantly improve
- participation in Maths and programming contests 
- proactiveness, interests are not limited to scope of work/study - love to study in depth (dig deeper)

Why uni? 
- needed background/base for improvement, laboratories, professors, better investment into science
- interaction with students from all the globe
- international recognition of the degree
- opportunity to continue work for PhD studies
