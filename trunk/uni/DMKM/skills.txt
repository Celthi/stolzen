Social skills and competences:

Social skills and competences refer to living and working with other people, in positions where communication is important and situations where teamwork is essential (for example culture and sports), in multicultural environments, etc.

I am a good team player. From 2007 to 2010 I was a part of collegiate team in programming contests where I learned to collaborate efficiently. 
In general, I possess good communication skills, gained through constant collaboration with my teammates, classmates, teachers and supervisors. 
As a team player, I am able to
• understand the value of collaboration
• initiate and join discussions
• express thoughts in a structured way, efficiently conveying the ideas
• listen actively and ask clarifying questions
• work out mutually agreeable solution (compromise or win-win)
• provide an well-supported position and to perceive opposite opinion
• admit mistakes, not taking a defensive position
• involve other team members in problem resolution
• propose options

Plus, I can
• use English fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions

Also,
• I can easily acclimatize to a new culture: I have worked in the USA twice (summer 2009 and summer 2010), and I've been working in Poland for half a year.
• I am eager to absorb other cultures. Apart from the US and Poland, I have been to China many times and I enjoyed learning their traditions.
