Figure 1

\

(a) Left panel: One of the decision trees (pruned) obtained from random forest. It clearly shows relationships between activity and x coordinate of body jerk signals, x and y coordinates of gravity acceleration plus FFT of body acceleration magnitude.

(b) Middle panel: Gravity acceleration [y variable] versus body jerk [x variable], colored by performed (actual) activity. There are obvious albeit slightly entangled clusters.

(c) Right Panel: Gravity acceleration, y versus x coordinates, colored by actual activity. Again, there are obvious albeit slightly entangled clusters.
