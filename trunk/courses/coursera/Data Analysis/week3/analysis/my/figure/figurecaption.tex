Figure 1

\

(a) Left panel: A box plot of interest rate versus requested amount. Requested amount sample is split into five intervals and on the x-axis the medians of which are shown. This figure shows that there is a relationship between interest rate and requested amount.

(b) Middle panel: A lot of the residuals from a linear model relating interest rate to amount requested, colored by loan length groups. There are two obvious albeit slightly entangled clusters.

(c) Right Panel: A lot of the residuals from a linear model relating interest rate to amount requested and debt-to-income ratio adjusted for 2-level factor variable for loan length and 14-level variable for loan purpose. The residuals are colored by loan length groups. There are two obvious and separated clusters.
